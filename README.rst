Introduction
============

``python-magnatune`` provides a simple command line utility called ``magnatune`` that can be used to search the `magnatune`_ database and get the streaming urls.

For example, to get all the albums from Curl ::

    magnatune --artist Curl

To get the streaming urls of all songs from Curl ::

The result can be user with mpc, for example to add all those songs to mpd ::

    magnatune --artist Curl --stream | mpc add
